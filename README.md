# ðŸ§  Deep Neural Network for Predicting Life Span

Welcome to the Deep Neural Network project designed to predict your estimated time of passing. This innovative model uses advanced algorithms to estimate the age at which you might pass away based on various input parameters.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Leverages state-of-the-art neural network techniques to provide predictions on your life span.
- **Free to Use**: Access the model without any cost, though credit is required for usage.
